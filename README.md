## 🚀 DevOps & Cloud Automation Portfolio — Naveen R

During my **career break (Dec 2024 – Present)**, I focused on deepening my expertise in **DevOps**, **Cloud** and **DevSecOps automation** by building multiple real-world, hands-on projects.

Each repository demonstrates **practical implementations** of:

- **CI/CD Automation** – End-to-end pipelines with secure build, test, and deploy workflows.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and CloudFormation.  
- **Containerization & Orchestration** – Dockerized workloads orchestrated on Kubernetes (EKS/ECS).  
- **GitOps Workflows** – Continuous deployment and environment management using ArgoCD & Helm.  
- **Security Automation** – Vulnerability scanning, image signing, and policy enforcement with Trivy, Cosign and OPA.  

> 💡 These projects reflect my continuous learning, hands-on problem-solving, and automation-first approach to modern DevOps and cloud engineering.
