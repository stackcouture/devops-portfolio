## 🚀 DevOps & Cloud Automation Portfolio — Naveen R

During my **career break (Dec 2024 – Present)**, I focused on deepening my expertise in **DevOps**, **Cloud** and **DevSecOps automation** by building multiple real-world, hands-on projects.

Each repository demonstrates **practical implementations** of:

- **CI/CD Automation** – End-to-end pipelines with secure build, test, and deploy workflows.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and CloudFormation.  
- **Containerization & Orchestration** – Dockerized workloads orchestrated on Kubernetes (EKS/ECS).  
- **GitOps Workflows** – Continuous deployment and environment management using ArgoCD & Helm.  
- **Security Automation** – Vulnerability scanning, image signing, and policy enforcement with Trivy, Cosign and OPA.  

> 💡 These projects reflect my continuous learning, hands-on problem-solving, and automation-first approach to modern DevOps and cloud engineering.

#### ⚡ 5. Serverless Real-Time Weather App
**Tech Stack:** AWS Lambda (Python), API Gateway, DynamoDB, OpenWeather API, IAM, CORS  

- Developed a **serverless, event-driven architecture** fetching live weather data via API Gateway 
  and Lambda.  
- Stored results in DynamoDB for real-time retrieval, applying **least-privilege IAM roles** and   
  **CORS-enabled REST endpoints**.  
- Achieved **40% faster data retrieval** and **30% cost reduction** via a fully scalable, 
  zero-maintenance design.

### 🛡️ 6. Kyverno Policy — Kubernetes Policy Automation
**Tech Stack:** Kubernetes, Kyverno, YAML, ClusterPolicy, NetworkPolicy 

- Implemented **Kyverno policies** to enforce, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources using    
  YAML — no coding required.  
- Built **ClusterPolicies** to automatically create and validate NetworkPolicies, ensuring 
  namespace-level security and compliance.  
- Designed rules to **enforce Pod security standards**, auto-generate missing labels, and block 
  insecure configurations.  
- Strengthened cluster governance and **reduced security misconfigurations** through automated   
  policy enforcement.

### 🔄 7. Kubernetes Config & Secret Reloader — Stakater Reloader Automation
**Tech Stack:** Kubernetes, Stakater Reloader, Helm, ConfigMap, Secret, GitOps  

- Implemented **automated reload mechanism** in Kubernetes to restart pods when ConfigMaps or 
  Secrets are updated — powered by **Stakater Reloader**.  
- Demonstrated how Reloader **detects configuration changes** and triggers rolling restarts for 
  Deployments, StatefulSets or DaemonSets, ensuring apps always run with the latest configuration.  
- Built complete manifests for namespace, RBAC, deployment and reloader setup.   
- Enabled **zero-downtime configuration rollouts** and simplified secret rotation by integrating  
  with external secret stores.
